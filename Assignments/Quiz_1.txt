1)does it always yield a result?
No

2)what if the values in the given function tend to be of an order of magnitude like 10^10 rather than 1?

The time will be increased.

3)are there values of dfbydx that might cause a problem?
Yes
dybydx can not be zero, which will throw an error

4)what is perhaps the biggest issue with the design of the program? Hint: think about dfbydx.
compatibility of dfbydx with the function "f" cannot be found.

5)possible bonus points for other legitimate problems that you identify and solve.
The value of x is hard coded. Which is not a valid method. Instead we can have variables which would take many values by using functions or methods.
